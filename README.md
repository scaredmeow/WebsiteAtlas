The Website Atlas training app will develop modules that are offered to all individuals who are willing to develop their skills and expand their knowledge in web development. The Website Atlas training app is divided into four topics that are primarily used in web development. This includes the four web app languages namely, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and MySQL. For each topic, there will be modules, discussions, videos, and audios to further supplement learning. After successfully completing each topic, a quiz will be provided to assess the individualâ€™s knowledge about the specific topic wherein the learner must have a passing grade. If the student fails to pass the assessment, then he has to wait for x hours to try again.The ultimate goal of the Website Atlas training app is to provide a strong foundation, necessary information, and skills to learners and aspiring web developers to develop expertise in creating their own websites.
